# Test procedure

Run tests in increasing order of risk. Record the date, software revision, hardware revision, and test result for each session.

## 1. Static checks

```bash
python -m py_compile Control/main.py Cockpit/app.py
python -m py_compile Control/main.py Cockpit/app.py Cockpit/auth.py
```

Confirm that the changed KiCad files open without recovery warnings and that firmware compiles for the selected board.

## 2. Broker and web smoke test

Start Mosquitto, then start Cockpit. Verify:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/json/
```

Publish a harmless test value and confirm it appears in the Cockpit MQTT console/dashboard:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t system/uptime -m '0 00:00:01'
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t system/uptime -C 1 -v
```

Also verify `/ws/telemetry` in the browser, `/api/session` before and after login, anonymous view-only access, and Login/logout navigation state.

## 3. Serial protocol test

Connect one controller with actuators disabled. Confirm that startup identification and heartbeat records are received, that malformed records do not crash the control loop, and that Adler-16 IDs match the documented topic.

## 4. Sensor test

With propulsion still disabled, verify system uptime/time, battery telemetry, water sensors, AHRS values, and leak status. Compare displayed units with the raw MQTT payloads.

## 5. Actuator bench test

With thrusters physically disconnected or mechanically restrained, issue one output command at a time. Verify zero, positive, negative, range limits, stop behavior, and restart behavior.

## 6. Dry integration test

Connect the full electronics stack without placing the vehicle in water. Verify network, MQTT, cameras, Cockpit routes, board heartbeats, power telemetry, and emergency-stop behavior.

Verify Motion recording, still capture, gallery display, download links, configured recording duration, and free-space retention using a non-production media directory.

## 7. Wet test

Only after the dry test passes: inspect seals and penetrators, perform a tethered shallow-water test, check leak detection continuously, and keep a physical power cutoff available.

## Current limitations

The repository does not currently contain a comprehensive automated test suite. Existing files named `test*` are historical/integration experiments, not a reliable acceptance suite.
